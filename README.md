# STM32L011F4P6 Base Converter

This project is based around the STM32L011F4P6 chip and uses SPI with DMA to control a LCD screen. The user input will be done via a multiplexed keypad. The end goal of this project will be a handheld base converter. 

# To-do list
* Implement a way to clear numbers on screen and allow user to input a new number
* Add a easy way to know where the cursor placement is when inputting a number

# Hardware
* Waiting on switches to arrive to build final keypad
* After above tasks are finished it will be time to build final PCB + case
