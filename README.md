# STM32L011K4T6 Base Converter

This project is based around the STM32L011K4T6 chip and uses SPI with DMA to control a LCD screen. The user input will be done via a multiplexed keypad. The end goal of this project will be a handheld base converter. 

# To-do list
* Add a easy way to know where the cursor placement is when inputting a number
* Add proper delay functions
* Add stop mode while main_menu
* Incorporate ways to turn off unneeded outputs(columns on keypad)

# Hardware
* Waiting on switches to arrive to build final keypad
* After above tasks are finished it will be time to build final PCB + case
