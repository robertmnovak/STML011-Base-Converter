# STM32L011F4P6 Base Converter

This project is based around the STM32L011F4P6 chip and uses SPI with DMA to control a LCD screen. The user input will be done via a multiplexed keypad. The end goal of this project will be a handheld base converter. 

# To-do list
* Add Keypad Functionality
* Add base converter functions
* Check out ways to incorporate low power modes

# Hardware
* Waiting on PCB of dev board to arrive to verify it works
* Waiting on switches to arrive to build actual keypad
* After above tasks are finished it will be time to build final PCB + case
