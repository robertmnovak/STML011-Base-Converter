# STM32L011F4P6 Base Converter

This project is based around the STM32L011F4P6 chip and uses SPI with DMA to control a LCD screen. The user input will be done via a multiplexed keypad. The end goal of this project will be a handheld base converter. 

# To-do list
* Incorporate low power modes
* Finish the rest of the keypad functions ( waiting on switches to come in)
* Add option to choose which mode a user can input numbers (currently only hex)

# Hardware
* Waiting on PCB of dev board to arrive to verify it works
* Waiting on switches to arrive to build actual keypad
* After above tasks are finished it will be time to build final PCB + case
