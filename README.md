# STM32L011F4P6 Base Converter

This project is based around the STM32L011F4P6 chip and uses SPI with DMA to control a LCD screen. The user input will be done via a multiplexed keypad. The end goal of this project will be a handheld base converter. 

# To-do list
* Finish the rest of the keypad functions (waiting on switches to come in)
* Add a way to know which base you are inputting(hex, binary, or decimal)
* Add a easy way to know where the cursor placement is when inputting a number

# Hardware
* Waiting on PCB of dev board to arrive to verify it works
* Waiting on switches to arrive to build actual keypad
* After above tasks are finished it will be time to build final PCB + case
